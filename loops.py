# # Often these iteration variables go through a sequence of number."

# # what wrong with this loop , always is True

# # Breaking Out of a loop
# #
# # "The break statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately followings the loop
# # its like a loop test that can happen anywhere in the body of the loop"

# # "the continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps
# # to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration"

# Define loops
# "quite often we have a lsit of items of the lines in a file effectively a finite set of things"
# "we can write a loop to run once for each of items in a set using the python for construc"
# "These loops are called definite loops because they execute an exact nuber of times"
# "we say that define loops iterate through the members of a set"

# A simple definite loop

# Looking at in

# "The iteration variable 'Iterates' through the sequence(ordered set)"
# "The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence"
# "the iteration variable moves through all of the values in the sequence"

# Making smart loops
# " the trick is knowing something aboutwhole drop  when you are stuck writting code that only sees one entry at a time"
# "set some variables ot initial values"
# "look for something or do each entry separately updating a variable"
# "look at the varibales"
